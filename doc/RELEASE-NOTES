UnrealIRCd 4.2.2-dev Release Notes
=================================

<<TODO>>

Enhancements:
* New set::outdated-tls-policy which describes what to do with clients
  that use outdated SSL/TLS protocols (eg: TLSv1.0) and ciphers.
  The default settings are to warn in all cases: users connecting,
  opers /OPER'ing up and servers linking in. The user will see a message
  telling them to upgrade their IRC client.
  This should help with migrating such users, since in the future, say one
  or two years from now, we would want to change the default to only allow
  TSLv1.2+ with ciphers that provide Forward Secrecy. Instead of rejecting
  clients without any error message, this provides a way to warn them and
  give them some time to upgrade their outdated IRC client.

Major issues fixed:

Minor issues fixed:
* "link-security" was incorrectly downgraded from level 2 to 1 if spkifp
  was used as an authentication method.

Deprecated:

Module coders:
* New hook HOOKTYPE_WELCOME (aClient *acptr, int after_numeric): allows you
  to send a message at very specific places during the initial welcome
  https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Dev:Hook_API#HOOKTYPE_WELCOME

Future versions:
* We intend to change the default plaintext oper policy from 'warn' to 'deny'
  in the year 2019. This will deny /OPER when used from a non-SSL connection.
  For security, IRC Operators should really use SSL/TLS!
